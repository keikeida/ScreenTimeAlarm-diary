		<p>Screen Time Alarm is an app that could assist on users to have less screen time so to prevent harm for the eyes and sometimes wasting time. The app advises the user depending on their daily schedule when it is to best be off their devices and when to take some stretches.</p>

		<heading><strong>Development Diary</strong></heading>
		<p> Initially the plan was to build an app but from the feedback given from the first assignment : to build something that involves more of the internet I built on Adobe XD a part of a protype of the app that can be accessed by anyone online. The link is down below.  </p>
	  <p>I began this idea as a timer that will go off when the user has been on their devices for an excessive amount time. But I came to the realisation that not many will get off their devices even if alarmed as our lives are now centered around technology. Therefore, I thought, rather than creating an app that forces people off the necessary, it is more significant to create something that can work around it. </p>
		<p>So I popped up with a plan of an app that would advise people to do certain activities during their day to release the stress from their long stares at the screen. These activities vary depending on their daily schedule and habits.</p>
		
		<p>Draft of questions that will ask out users daily habits: </p>
	  <p>-Do you work in an office?&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>- Do you work on computers?</p>
	  <p>- Are you often on your phone in your spare time?</p>
	  <p><strong>Final Questions</strong></p>

		<p>Further I developed on Adobe XD an eye-stretching animation video as one of the stress releasing activities from the results of the survey.</p>
